Stats (plugin for Omeka)
========================

[Stats] is a plugin for [Omeka] that counts views of pages in order to know the
least popular record and the most viewed pages. It provides useful infos on
visitors too (language, referrer...). So this is an analytics tool like [Piwik]
(open source), [Google Analytics] (proprietary, no privacy) and other hundreds
of such [web loggers].

It has some advantages over them:
- simple to manage (a normal plugin, with same interface);
- adapted (stats can be done by record and not only by page);
- integrated, so stats can be displayed on any page easily;
- extensible (for plugins makers, the filter `stats_record` allows other
plugins to get stats for a specific record type);
- informative (query, referrer, user agent and language are saved; all stats can
be browsed by public);
- count of direct download of files;
- full control of pruducted data;
- respect of privacy (if wanted!).

On the other hand, some advanced features are not implemented, especially
a detailled board with advanced filters. Nevertheless, logs and data can be
exported via mysql to a spreadsheet like [LibreOffice] or another specialized
statistic tool, where any stats can be calculated.


Installation
------------

Uncompress files and rename plugin folder "Stats".

Then install it like any other Omeka plugin and follow the config instructions.

To count direct download of files, you need to add a line in the beginning off
`.htaccess`:

```
RewriteEngine on
RewriteRule ^files/original/(.*)$ http://www.example.com/download/files/original/$1 [NC,L]
```

You can adapt `routes.ini` as you wish too.

If you use the anti-hotlinking feature of [Archive Repertory] to avoid bandwidth
theft, you should keep its rule. Stats for direct downloads of files will be
automatically added.

You can count fullsize files too, but this is not recommended, because in the
majority of themes, hits may increase even when a simple page is opened.


Browse Stats
------------

A summary of stats is displayed at `/stats/summary`.

Lists of stats by page, by record or by field are available too. They can be
ordered and filtered by anonymous / identified users, record types, etc.

These pages can be made available to authorized users only or to all public.

For plugins makers, panels can be added via the hook `stats_summary`.


Displaying some stats in the theme
----------------------------------

Stats of a page or record can be displayed on any page via three mechanisms.

* Hooks

An option allows to append the stats automatically on some records `show` and
`browse` pages via the hooks:

```php
fire_plugin_hook('public_items_show', array('view' => $this, 'item' => $item));
```

* Helpers

Helpers can be used for more flexibility:

```php
echo $this->stats()->position_record($record);
echo $this->stats()->text_page(current_url());
```

* Shortcodes

[Shortcodes] are supported (Omeka 2.2 or above). Some illustrative examples:

```
[stats_total]
[stats_total url="/"]
[stats_total record_type="Item"]
[stats_total record_type="Item" record_id=1]
[stats_position]
[stats_position url="/items/search"]
[stats_position record_type="Collection" record_id=1]
[stats_vieweds]
[stats_vieweds type="none"]
[stats_vieweds order="last" type="Item"]
[stats_vieweds order="most" type="download" number=1]
```

All arguments are optional. Arguments are:
* For `stats_total` and `stats_position`
  - `type`: If "download", group all downloaded files linked to the specified
  record (all files of an item, or all files of all items of a collection).
  Else, the type is automatically detected ("record" if a record is set, "page"
  if an url is set or if nothing is set).
  - `record_type`: one or multiple Omeka record type, e.g. "Item" or
  "Collection", or "File". By default, a viewed record is counted for each hit
  on the dedicated page of a record, like "/items/show/#". Alternatively, the
  url can be used (with the argument `url`, but to count the downloaded files,
  this is an obfuscated one except if [Archive Repertory] is used.
  - `record_id`: the identifier of the record (not the slug if any). It implies
  one specific `record_type` and only one. With `stats_position`, `record_id` is
  required when searching by record.
  - `url`: the url of a specific page. A full url is not needed; a partial Omeka
  url without web root is enough (in any case, web root is removed
  automatically). This argument is used too to know the total or the position of
  a file. This argument is not used if `record_type` argument is set.

* For `stats_vieweds`
  - `type`: If "page" or "download", most or last viewed pages or downloaded
  files will be returned. If empty or "all", it returns only pages with a
  dedicated record. If "none", it returns pages without dedicated record. If one
  or multiple Omeka record type, e.g. "Item" or "Collection", most or last
  records of this record type will be returned.
  - `sort`: can be "most" (default) or "last".
  - `number`: number of records to return (10 by default).
  - `offset`: offset to set page to return.

The hook and the helper return the partial from the theme.

`stats_total` and `stats_position` return a simple number, surrounded by a
`span` tag when shortcode is used.
`stats_vieweds` returns an html string that can be themed.


Notes
-----

- Hits of anonymous users and identified users are counted separately.
- Only pages of the public theme are counted.
- Reload of a page generates a new hit (no check).
- IP can be hashed or not saved for privacy purpose.
- Currently, screen size is not detected.


Warning
-------

Use it at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases and to check
your archives regularly so you can roll back if needed.


Troubleshooting
